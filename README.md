# NN
EECS 738 - Implementing Neural Networks from Scratch

Patrick Canny & Liam Ormiston

## Background
The ultimate test of our machine learning prowess. Neural Networks are really hot right now, so making one from scratch seems like a good idea. We hope to learn more about what Neural Nets are the easiest to understand and explain to someone else.

## Ideas
We started by looking at a simple NN from a medium article that we found. Check out the NN.py file for this implementation in order to get our bearings. The article is here: [How to build your own Neural Network from scratch in Python](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-your-own-neural-network-from-scratch-in-python-68998a08e4f6)
