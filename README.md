EECS 738 - Implementing Neural Networks from Scratch

Patrick Canny & Liam Ormiston

## Background
The ultimate test of our machine learning prowess. Neural Networks are really hot right now, so making one from scratch seems like a good idea. We hope to learn more about what Neural Nets are the easiest to understand and explain to someone else.
